In Urban areas Car parking is a big issue for public places. Due to the shortage of
parking space , high traffic visitors face parking issues everyday.

1. To detect whether the nearby place is suitable for parking your vehicle or
not.
2. If it is not give an sign for not parking and if it is suitable give an sign for
